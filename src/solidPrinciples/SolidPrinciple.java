        /* 1. Single Responsibility Principle:
              A class should have only one reason to change.

        2. Open/Closed Principle:
              Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

        3. Liskov Substitution Principle:
             Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. meaning
             If S is a subclass of T, you should be able to replace T with
             S without breaking behavior.

        4. Interface Segregation Principle:
             Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
             meaning Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

        5. Dependency Inversion Principle:
             High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
             Both should depend on abstractions.
             Depend on interfaces, not concrete classes.
